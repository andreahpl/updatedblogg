  <p>What's up?
  My name is Andrea (pronounced as 'and-dree-ah'). Though life has been a continuous routine of driving, work and school at the moment, this blog is reflection of my creative outlets that keep me sane. In a way using my daily regimen as excuses lead to hindrances, preventing what can be possible. After my last day of high school, I realized how precious time is and the actual possibilites that can be accomplished within a day, even a week, but honestly I'm pretty drained and lacking self-motivation. Getting rejected by 7 of 8 schools made me wonder if putting in hard work was worth it, or even if trying would pay off. But now as a first year, I have clean slate and can improve the person I was even last month. I'm very grateful for the programs that accepted me because Vision and CSSI are probably the best experiences in my life!!! If those events never happened, I would really question why my ass is on this planet. For real. I can talk about it all day. Honestly things are not as bad and I never really felt more independent till now, but I think karma is getting me on the roads for my bad driving in the past. :p</p>
  <p>Anyways see me at CAL 2 years from now!
